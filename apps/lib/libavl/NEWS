Changes for version 2.0.3:

  Previously, all of libavl was under GPL version 2.  Now, the libavl
  book is under the GNU Free Documentation License (version 1.2 or
  later), the libraries under the GNU Lesser General Public License
  (version 3 or later), and programs under the GNU General Public
  License (version 3 or later).  Refer to README for details.

  Fix incompatibility between libavl and recent versions of Texinfo.
  libavl now recommends Texinfo 4.8.

  BST_MAX_HEIGHT, AVL_MAX_HEIGHT, RB_MAX_HEIGHT were fixed to use the
  maximum, not minimum, height of a tree, and to have reasonable
  values for 64-bit systems.  The lower bound on the number of nodes
  in an AVL tree was fixed also.

  Fixed the spelling of referenced paper author Quentin Stout's name.

  Fixed a few minor typographical problems.

  Updated INSTALL to explain the intended use of libavl.

  The PDF version of libavl is now generated with pdftex, instead of
  using dvipdfm.

  libavl now has a dedicated mailing list for reporting bugs:
  bug-avl@gnu.org.

Changes for version 2.0.2:

  Fixed a bug in tavl_delete() found by Petr Silhavy.  This is the
  same bug fixed by the patch posted to the libavl website.  Both the
  bug and patch are quite old.

  Version 2.0.1 was (again) incompatible with recent versions of
  Texinfo.  libavl now recommends Texinfo 4.7.

  The HTML output now links from each code segment to a fully-expanded
  version of the code segment.  Thanks to "Nobody" <nobody@cox.net>
  for the inspiration.

  A few typos have been fixed in the text, and some esthetic fixes
  have been made to the libavl library code.

Changes for version 2.0.1:

  Some of the exercise answers in version 2.0 were misnumbered.  This
  has been corrected.

  Version 2.0 was incompatible with recent versions of Texinfo.
  libavl now requires Texinfo 4.1 or later to build the HTML version
  and at least that version is recommended in any case.

  The book can now be produced in an attractive HTML format.
  Imagemagick (http://www.imagemagick.org) is a new build requirement
  for the HTML version if any .tree files are modified.  Ghostscript
  is also needed.

  A bug in the "texiweb" utility that caused some files to be
  needlessly recompiled has been fixed.

  dvipdfm (http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm) is now used for
  generating the PDF version of the book, resulting in better quality.

  A few typos have been fixed in the text, and some esthetic fixes
  have been made to the libavl library code.

Changes for version 2.0:

  Major new release.  Source and binary incompatible with previous
  releases.

  Now written as a literate program using a custom software
  documentation system called TexiWEB.

  Memory allocation for trees can be more flexibly controlled.
  Allocation failure is no longer a fatal error.

  Traversers are generalized to allow iteration forward and backward
  in any kind of tree.  Traversal can begin anywhere in a tree.  Many
  other new traversal features.

  Several new kinds of trees.  Unbalanced ordinary binary trees will
  be fully rebalanced automatically if they grow too tall for a
  fixed-size stack.  Other kinds of unbalanced binary trees will never
  be rebalanced automatically, but there is a function to call to do
  it manually:

    * Unbalanced binary trees, in bst.c and bst.h.
    * Unbalanced threaded binary trees, in tbst.c and tbst.h.
    * Threaded red-black trees, in trb.c and trb.h.
    * Unbalanced right-threaded binary trees, in rtbst.c and rtbst.h.
    * Right-threaded red-black trees, in rtrb.c and rtrb.h.
    * Unbalanced binary trees with parent pointers, in pbst.c and pbst.h.
    * AVL trees with parent pointers, in pavl.c and pavl.h.
    * Red-black trees with parent pointers, in prb.c and prb.h.

  Tree destruction algorithm changed to avoid use of a stack.

Changes for version 1.4.0:

  Implemented red-black trees.

  New functions, *_init_traverser(), to initialize a *_traverser
  structure.  New macros *_TRAVERSER_INIT for same purpose.

Changes for version 1.3.0:

  Now uses Autoconf and Automake to configure.  Thanks to Alexandre
  Oliva <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>.

  New: automated testing with `make check'.

  Fixes for strict ANSI C compliance.

  Fixed useless assertions.  Fixed bug regarding empty trees for some
  operations with threaded and right-threaded trees.  Thanks to
  "Ficarra, David W, NNAD" <dficarra@att.com>.

  New functions, avl*_find_close(), for finding a node in the tree
  with a value close to a specified value.  See documentation and
  source code for more details.  Thanks to Thomas Binder
  <binder@iue.tuwien.ac.at>.

Changes for version 1.2.9:
 
  Fix typos in documentation.  Thanks to onTy Toom <onty@yahoo.com>.

Changes for version 1.2.8:

  Fixed typos in assertions.  Thanks to Girish Zambre
  <gzambre@sprynet.com>.

  Better support for gcc 2.7.x.

Changes for versions 1.2.4, 1.2.5, 1.2.6, 1.2.7:

  Documentation updates.  Thanks to Ron Pfeifle <rpfeifle@aw.sgi.com>,
  Jason Eisner <jeisner@linc.cis.upenn.edu>, and others.

Changes for version 1.2.3:

  The library's allocation function xmalloc() can easily be overridden
  by the library's user.  Thanks to Clayton Weaver <cgweav@eskimo.com>
  for the idea.

Changes for version 1.2.2:

  Documentation fixes.  Thanks to Akim Demaille <demaille@inf.enst.fr>
  for pointing these out.

Changes for version 1.2.1:

  Bug fixes.

Changes for version 1.2.0:

  Implemented right-threaded trees.

  Added functions to convert among AVL tree types.

  First GNU release.

Changes for version 1.1.0:

  Implemented threaded trees.

Changes for version 1.0:

  First public release.
